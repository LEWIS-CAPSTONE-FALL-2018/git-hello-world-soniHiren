                                Steps to running the Hello World program:
1. Open any software that executes Python code, such as Visual Studio.
2. Download the file, assignment1.py and copy and paste the code into an integrated development environment (IDE).
3. Unless using Python Idle, in which case you would click under Run and then Run Module to execute the program, create a new Python Application in Visual Studio. This creates a solution file, so that you can run the program, incase you do not have the necessary files to execute it if it was downloaded.
4. Click start or debug and start without debugging to execute the Hello World program.
This will then open up in a console window or shell displaying the output of the program, which the result is Hello World!
